This is the frontend script for the website at GrammatikTAK.com. 
The website is not longer public, but can be run from this repo if wanted. Run the index.html file locally to see the website.

## Todo:
- [x] see measurements based on each school, maybe this should be avaliable for schools to check at all times. @https://grammatiktak.com/data
- [x] Be able to put in code in frontend to unlock better features.
- [ ] Send school id to backend
- [ ] School code should work (green if correct, red if not and then reset, should load from cookie)
- [ ] Authentication token (github secret) to backend
